            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>To bring the world to those companies and organizations in need of reaching out to them whether by hand-held device or computer.  In this day, mobile users now outpace desktop accessing of the Internet.  We want to help bring outdated sites up to current standards and activate those organizations who have yet reached out through this medium.</p>
